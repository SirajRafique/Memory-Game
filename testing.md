## Manual Testing 
-----------------------------------------------------------

- When the user hovers over the buttons the buttons zoom out and the cursor changes to a pointer. 
  This works as expected. 

- When the user selects start the background is blurred and a window pops up asking the user to choose a difficuly level. 
  Works as expected. 

- When the user hovers over the easy, medium and hard buttons they zoom out and the cursor changes to a pointer.
  Works as expected. 

- Once the user has chosen their preferred level, 16 blue squares pop up with a home logo, timer, flips and restart icon. The background is blurred. 
  Works as expected. 

- When the user runs out of time another a box pops up in the foreground telling the user they ran out of time and asking if they want to try again? Or they can return to the homepage by clicking on the home icon. 
  Works as expected. 

- When the user finishes the game they are congratulated with a message highlighting the remaining time and number of flips taken. 
  Works as expected. 

- When the user selects the help button a window pops up with a detailed illustration showing the user how to play. They can close the window by selecting close. 
  Works as expected. 

- When the user selects the feedback button a form pops out asking the user to input their details. If all fields are not complete an error message is shown. 
  Works as expected. 

- When the user submits the form they are directed to a 404 error page. This needs to be linked to my email which I haven't done as this is a project.
