I received Inspiration for this project from the mini project Love Maths and my current part-time work as an English Language Teacher. 

The game has been kept simple to allow for enhanced usability; it's interactive and the user can navigate with ease.

The game has been made desirable and responsive for all device sizes; giving the user the best experience all-round.
