# Memory Game - Body Parts
--------------------------

## Introduction 

Welcome to my second project (MS2). This is a game that tests your memory while also learning the body parts in English. It is designed for children or elementary level learners.  

The primary goal of the website is for users to learn and/or practice their English in the form of a game. 

There are 8 pictures and 8 cards. The user needs to select a difficulty level and then match the pairs within the time limit set to complete the game. 

You can view the deployed game [here](https://sirajrafique.github.io/Memory-Game/)

**1. UX**
---------

I received Inspiration for this project from the mini project Love Maths and my current part-time work as an English Language Teacher. 

I actually use this particular game when teaching my students new vocabulary, I call it pelmanism. Up until now I have just been creating it manually.  

The game has been kept simple to allow for enhanced usability; it's interactive and the user can navigate with ease.

The game has been made desirable and responsive for all device sizes; giving the user the best experience all-round.

**2. Features**
------------

**Home Page:**

When the page loads you are presented with a background image of a whiteboard, books and a globe to give it that school effect; after all it is an English learning/memory game. 
Instantly you know what the topic is - Body parts. On the top right hand corner there are some links to the sociak media accounts. 
The user sees three buttons, Start/Help/Feedback.

When the user selects help an window pops up with detailed illustrations of how to play the game. 

The feedback button brings up a form where they can leave a message. 

When the user clicks start, a window pops up asking them to choose a difficulty level. The difference in levels are explained in the 'help' section. 

Each of the buttons have a hover effect when the user runs the mouse over it - telling them what they are about to select. 


**The Game**

When the game loads the background image is blurred to create focus and the user is presented with 16 blue squares. 
Above the squares they have a home icon where they can revert back to the home page at anytime. 
There is also a timer, highlighting how much time is remaining. 
Flips tell you how many times you flipped a card. The lower the number the better. 
On the top right of the squares there is a refresh button - where you can reshuffle the cards or simply start again. 
If you run out of time a box appears asking if you want to try again? or you can click the home button and return to the homepage.
