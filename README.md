# Memory Game - Body Parts
--------------------------


## Introduction 

Welcome to my second project (MS2). This is a memory game for learning the body parts in English aimed at children or elementary level learners.  

The primary goal of the website is for users to learn and/or practice their english in the form of a game. 

There are 8 pictures and 8 cards. The user needs to match the pairs inside a minute to complete the game. 

You can view the deployed game [here]()

I received Inspiration for this project from the mini project Love Maths and my current part-time work as an English Language Teacher. 

I actually use this particular game when teaching my students new vocabulary, I call it pelmanism. Up until now I have just been creating it manually.  

The game has been kept simple to allow for enhanced usability; it's interactive and the user can navigate with ease.

The game has been made desirable and responsive for all device sizes; giving the user the best experience all-round.
